👋 Hi, I’m Denis, currently honing my skills in data analytics at Turing College.

👀 I’m interested in leveraging data to derive meaningful insights and drive informed decision-making.

🌱 I’m currently learning various aspects of data analytics, including databases like SQL and MySQL, data visualization tools like Google Spreadsheets and PowerBI, and analytical methods such as cohort analysis and churn analysis.

💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on projects that involve applying analytical methods to real-world data challenges.

⚡ Fun fact: I love exploring various commercials and filming projects backstage!
